Explanation:

In this scenario, we want to verify that users can edit or delete their own reviews on the web-based login system. To do this, we will log in to the system as the user, navigate to the review page, edit or delete the review, and verify that the changes are saved and reflected in the review list. We will repeat this process to verify that the user can delete their own review.

Test Case ID: TC-001

Test Case Name: Verify that users can edit or delete their own reviews

Test Case Objective: To ensure that users can edit or delete their own reviews on the web-based login system.

Test Case Preconditions:

* A user has written at least one review
* The user has the ability to edit or delete their own review

Test Case Steps:

1. Log in to the system as the user
2. Navigate to the review page
3. Edit or delete the review
4. Verify that the changes are saved and reflected in the review list
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to verify that the user can delete their own review

Test Case Expected Results:

* The user should be able to edit or delete their own review
* The changes should be saved and reflected in the review list
* The user should be able to delete their own review

Test Case Risks:

* The user may not be able to edit or delete their own review if they do not have the necessary permissions
* The system may not allow the user to delete their own review if it is the last review for the product or service

Test Case Assumptions:

* The user has the necessary permissions to edit or delete their own review
* The system will allow the user to delete their own review if it is the last review for the product or service

Note: This is just one example of a test case for the scenario ""Verify that users can edit or delete their own reviews"". You may need to modify the test case based on the specific requirements of your system and the test environment."
